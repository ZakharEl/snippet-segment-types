# Snippet Segment Types
This library implements [Snippet Body](https://github.com/ZakharEl/snippet-body.git). It defines what functionality to include or exclude for snippets by what InteractiveSegment implementors (Placeholder, Variable, etc) it includes or excludes. This library does not include parsers. This is the responsability of another progam that uses this library so as to enable custom snippet body string syntax. This also achieves the state of being unopinionated for parsing a snippet body string into segments. This is prealpha software at the moment and it's history is subject to being overwritten.
